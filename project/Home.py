st.markdown("# How many diabetes supplies do I need?")

"""
I've got 8 infusion set, 11 reservoirs and 3 pump batteries left.

- How many do I need to order to cover my needs for the next three months?
- Until when can I sustain on my current stock?
- How many articles do I need to bring with me on holiday?

With this web app, I've tried to create a tool for at least myself and hopefully others to quickly make the calculations I need.

Try it out!

Navigate to the side bar to check out:
- **Assess stock**: For most of your stock supply and order questions.
- **When order next**: What is the next date you need to order?
- **Items overview**: An overview of the diabetes supplies that are currently covered by this app.

Please let me know what functionality you are missing through a [github issue](https://github.com/JannekeHulsen/assess_diabetes_stock/issues).
In the future, I'll add other ways for contact :)
